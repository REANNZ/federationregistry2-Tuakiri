      <p>Here are some common things you might need to configure at your Identity Provider in order to successfully login:</p>\n\
      <h3>1. Metadata</h3>\n\
      <p>Ensure you've correctly configured AAF metadata for use with your Identity Provider. Take a look at <a href="http://support.aaf.edu.au/entries/22529592-AAF-Metadata">our helpful Metadata guide</a> for more information.\n\
      <h3>2. Time Synchronization</h3>\n\
      <p>\n\
        Ensure your Identity Provider server is synced to an upstream time server, this is critically important for federated authentication.\n\
      </p>\n\
      <h3>3. Required Attributes</h3>\n\
      <p>\n\
        In order to get access to the Federation Registry, you need an account provided by an Identity Provider that is active within the federation. Your Identity Provider <strong>must be configured to release the following attributes</strong> to this service:\n\
        <ul>\n\
          <li>commonName</li>\n\
          <li>mail</li>\n\
          <li>eduPersonTargetedID</li>\n\
          <li>auEduPersonSharedToken</li>\n\
        </ul>\n\
      </p>\n\
      <p>\n\
        Within the AAF we recommend automating this process.
