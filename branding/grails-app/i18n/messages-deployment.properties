fedreg.view.index.problems=<h2>Problems logging on?</h2> \
          <p>Here are some common things you might need to configure at your Identity Provider in order to successfully login.</p> \
          <h3>1. Metadata</h3> \
          <p>You've correctly configured AAF metadata at your IdP right? Maybe not? Take a look at this guide <a href="http://support.aaf.edu.au/entries/338216-three-versions-of-the-aaf-metadata-available">http://support.aaf.edu.au/entries/338216-three-versions-of-the-aaf-metadata-available</a> \
          <h3>2. Time Synchronization</h3> \
          <p> \
            Ensure your Identity Provider server is synced to an upstream time server, failure to do this will cause faults when logging in. \
          </p> \
          <h3>3. Required Attributes</h3> \
          <p> \
            In order to get access to the Federation Registry, you need an account provided by an Identity Provider that is active within the federation. Your Identity Provider <strong>must be configured to release the following attributes</strong> to this service: \
            <ul> \
              <li>givenName and surname or displayName</li> \
              <li>mail</li> \
              <li>eduPersonTargetedID</li> \
              <li>auEduPersonSharedToken</li> \
              <li>organisationName</li> \
            </ul> \
          </p> \
          <p> \
            Within the AAF we recommend automating this process, take a look at this guide for more information <a href="http://support.aaf.edu.au/entries/321600-automating-attribute-release">http://support.aaf.edu.au/entries/321600-automating-attribute-release</a>.
