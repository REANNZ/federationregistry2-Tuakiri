Nimble CSS
----------

Order of attributes:

* Mixins
* Float
* Position
* Margin
* Padding
* Height
* Width
* Alphabetical by attribute name(1)

1. Where it makes sense to order attributes by common display order i.e
for a table where thead comes before tbody in markup this ordering should be used in preference
to alphabetical ordering.
