Federation Registry 
Version 1.1 
27th January 2011

Federation Registry is an extensible, open web application that provides a central point of registration, management and reporting for identity and service providers participating in a standards compliant SAML 2 identity federation.

New Features
------------
* Enhanced overall project structure to guide new developers
* Introduced behaviour to domain objects particularly the concept of 'functioning'. Adopted several locations to make use of this to streamline MD generation, Rule generation, WAYF configs and the like
* Removed display of eduPersonTargetedID from administrators list for O/ED/IDP/SP, now shows organization instead
* Created i18n compliant tooltip solution. Added tooltips to all key fields and screens right across the UI
* Updated attribute view for IDP and SP to show categories. Core attributes now lead followed by optional with all alphabetically sorted
* Super admins can now delete 'standard' Entity Descriptors and associated cascaded children from web UI
* Branding is now a first class citizen in the project instead of being out on its own
* Apache 2.0 License requirements added to repository in preparation for OSS release
* Organization view now shows summary statistics about how many ED/IDP/SP children it has and the state of each
* When an IDP attribute set is modified the attribute filter page will advise of changes and provides ajax reload functionality for displayed policy
* SP Administrators can now edit the reasons for requesting particular attributes.
* Registration for O/IDP/SP now starts with an advisory page indicating what is required and provides an estimated completion time
* Service Categories and membership of each is now published via JSON for integration into public facing service catalogue
* Wide ranging optimisations to UI rendering model including various javascript re-writes for high performance. Page load times decreased by upto 400% on 1.0
* Supported IDP and SP versions now dynamically provided by the server allowing us to easily support Shibboleth version releases and other implementations in the 'easy registration' mode. Support for Shib 2.4 SP added already.
* IndexedEndpoint index value is no longer automatically calculated for MD rendering puproses. Administrators are able to configure this value from 1..n using the Endpoints UI for IDP/SP to match their local configuration
* The attribute DisplayName is now used as a fallback for account population for IDP that are unable/unwilling to supply givenName and surname.

Bug Fixes
---------
* Optional attribute comparison equality has incorrect display
* Default for wantAuthnRequestsSigned is wrong
* Setting of wantAuthnRequests signed on create and update views confusing to end users
* Duplicates when listing potential administrators for addition to IDP/SP
* Bootstrap doesn't redirect to Dashboard on DB population
* Github complains of no README
* Not using Grails is() call in some equals statements causing equality faults for hibernate proxied objects
* MD no longer renders ED that is childless
* No 'working' popup in top left of workflow state change submission
* SP registration asking for to much data and confusing end users, streamline process while still being suitable for service catalogue
* Session timeout to short at 30 minutes
* IDP/SP registration screen finalisation doesn't explicitly identify email as source of further communication
* Admin tab renders before IDP/SP WF finalizes and creates associated role
* Zenbox js load slow on IE and IE7 fires non SSL warning when loading remotely
* JQuery UI themed buttons not created by JS call not forward compatible with new releases
* SP endpoint created with wrong binding for httpArtifactACS
* Account creation doesn't gracefully handle null givenName or null surname

Installation
------------
Implementors are advised to ensure that the web server fronting your Tomcat instance is well tuned for high performance, modern web applications. In particular enablement of mod_deflate will add to the performance enhancements being delivered as part of this upgrade cycle.

1. Shutdown Metadata signing processes. As metadata generation code has been enhanced take a before copy of your unsigned metadata for comparison once the upgrade is complete.
2. Shutdown your tomcat instance
3. Execute the provided SQL hotfixes ensuring no errors are present:
	* indexedendpoint-hotfix.sql
4. Copy federationregistry-1.1.war to your $federationregistry/war directory
5. Edit $tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/federationregistry.xml to point to the new war file
6. Update your $federationregistry/conf/FedRegConfig.groovy file to include new sections as demonstrated in FedRegConfig.groovy.example specifically provide values for deployment.environment and ensure configuration is supplied to knownimplementations for both identityproviders and serviceproviders
7. Restart your tomcat instance
8. Ensure you can login as normal and access the administrative console
9. Execute the following hotfix scripts ensuring no errors are present:
	* indexedendpoint-hotfix.groovy
	* acsartifact-hotfix.groovy
10. Compare your previous and newly generated unsigned metadata documents, they should differ only in the timestamp in the main EntitiesDescriptor object
11. Test all other general functionality to your satisfaction
12. Restart Metadata signing processes
13. The upgrade is complete and the new version ready for end users.
