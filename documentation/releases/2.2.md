2. Potential XSS attack vector in flash message usage
3. Enhances defences against CSRF attacks
4. Remove Grails version from branding footer

#### Bug Fixes

1. \#85 - Incorrectly uses MailURI in contact search
2. \#105 - Incorrect reference to contact for workflow submitter
3. \#108 - Spelling mistake in UI

#### New Features

1. Upgrade to Grails release 2.2.0
2. Relax requirements on self signed certificates, no longer force EntityID check
3. Support for shibmd:scope. When scope is considered to contain regex metadata regex flag is set

### Important notes
#### Branding updates 
This update requires changes to your custom branding files.

You will need to undertake the following to your customised branding *.gsp files. Note both "replace with" strings below must have a trailing space. These are exact matches, **don't use a regex engine**.

	find:
	g.message(
	
	replace with: 
	g.message(encodeAs:"HTML"
	
	find:
	g:message
	
	replace with:
	g:message encodeAs="HTML"
	
_Known Gotcha_
The file _frbrowsercheck.gsp may be missing two required commas after the above find/replace. Here is a valid _frbrowsercheck.gsp for comparison if you have errors [github.com/ausaccessfed/virtualhomeregistry](github.com/ausaccessfed/virtualhomeregistry)

Thanks to the University of Illinois for their assistance in preparing this release.

	    Fix utilization report bug.

	    loop to approximate that functionality.

	    regexp patters in supplied scope and sets to true if they found.

	    Losen certificate requirements.
	    
	    Due to constant conflicts particuarly with SP that operate outside
	    of the AAF we are relaxing requirements of provided certificates.
	    
	    Both wildcard and non subject matching entityID certs are now accepted
	    by FR.
	
	commit bd04910a73c2f7519be37601546485063c9f0943
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Fri Mar 15 13:51:10 2013 +1000
	
	    Removing brittle workflow tests.
	    
	    These tests are constantly breaking with even minor grails version
	    changes.
	    
	    Corrected cases are present in AAF Base and will be utilised again
	    once FR is ported to that environment.
	
	commit 0fec2c9dcd0bcdfb914ea4128d97984254e546da
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Fri Mar 15 12:09:47 2013 +1000
	
	    Add CSRF tokens to core forms.
	    
	    Adds csrf token checks to our core registration forms
	    for O, IdP and SP.
	    
	    At this time other forms internal to the app are using javascript
	    submission. Setting and updating tokens on these type of form is not
	    currently supported. We'd need to review how this is handled much more
	    closely to support these forms.
	    
	    While not foolproof referer checks which are being carried out in the
	    filter should provide some protection for these non token providing
	    forms.
	
	commit 2bb4a044d28fe084ff254e1704748c825ee7f220

	Date:   Fri Mar 15 08:52:02 2013 +1000
	
	    Provide generic request and response verification/management.
	    
	    Ensures that incoming requests for types POST, PUT, DELETE are
	    undertaken with a refer that is the local server to lower CSRF risks.
	    
	    Ensures that all outbound requests are not cached as we run over SSL
	    and that OWASP recommended anti clickjaking headers are provided
	    as our app should never be embedded in a frame elsewhere.
	
	commit 92acf9325cc9c0743a7b316b2ad936f0b8ecbe26

	    Ensure login error echo screen correctly encodes headers + values.
	
	commit 9689377de86b0efab13eec0be847c06732b463ef
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu Mar 14 15:28:03 2013 +1000
	
	    Add further protection against XSS via defaults.
	    
	    grails.views.default.codec - Sets the default encoding regime for
	    GSPs - can be one of 'none', 'html', or 'base64' (default: 'none').
	    To reduce risk of XSS attacks, set this to 'html'.
	    
	    This commit changes our usage to 'html' across the project.
	
	commit f7bdd446a8ba16e68e0725a63634280beff1c59f
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu Mar 14 15:22:54 2013 +1000
	
	    Correct low level framework XSS vulnerabilities.
	    
	    Even with FR doing the right thing Grails 2.1.0 has vulnerabilities
	    of its own per http://jira.grails.org/browse/GRAILS-9247 which are
	    being triggered within the application.
	    
	    This code upgrades the application to Grails 2.1.4 which corrects
	    the underlying grails fault.
	
	commit ee39d96952f65ecadd1330edfd3fd940f6cb743a
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu Mar 14 15:19:53 2013 +1000
	
	    Correct XSS attack vector in reporting parsing.
	    
	    Reports where simply appending names of O, IdP and SP to output.
	    Where someone malicious had managed to get XSS into the displayName
	    field of these objects the vuln could be triggered.
	
	commit fa3c9b61e1c85d40564fa59414e7d37a4c217f0a
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu Mar 14 14:19:15 2013 +1000
	
	    Correct error with radioGroup and HTML encoding.
	    
	    With additional HTML encoding checks g:radioGroup was not functioning.
	    Changed to manually rendering of radio group HTML.
	
	commit 71af5d1a31433ac31b49213960ea216afb67d246
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu Mar 14 13:01:40 2013 +1000
	
	    Correct XSS attack vector in flash messages.
	    
	    Code to output flash messages was incorrectly printing the messages
	    without HTML encoding.
	
	commit 8be721c26688adb4dc8a068ef7d4758e766c2270
	Author: Bradley Beddoes <bradleybeddoes@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu Mar 14 12:48:20 2013 +1000
	
	    Correct XSS attack vector in i18n usage.
	    
	    Unfortunately the Grails provided <g:message> tag and
	    g.message() function do not encode their output to HTML by default.
	    
	    This had previously gone unchecked within FR. This commit sets all
	    usages of message to use encodeAs HTML except for 3 manually approved
	    locations (org/idp/sp create message) that does not output any user
	    supplied data.
	    
	    The messages within i18n properties have also been cleaned and all
	    markup removed sans the 3 cases above.

	    Closes #85.

	    FR 2 method.
